{"id":"bp6-63a","title":"Investigate file watcher responsiveness degradation","description":"The file watcher has become unresponsive after recent changes to prevent refresh flashes. The system is now so slow it's unusable.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis Needed:\n1. Current implementation has retry logic with sleep() in watcher callback (lines 509-524)\n2. Debounce increased from 200ms to 1000ms (line 531)\n3. Checksum computation removed in latest commit\n4. File reading happens synchronously in watcher callback\n\nImpact:\n- UI is unresponsive to beads file changes\n- User experience is degraded to unusable levels\n\nInvestigation Required:\n- Identify if blocking sleep in watcher callback is causing issues\n- Determine optimal debounce timing\n- Check if file read retries are necessary\n- Review if checksum approach was better\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- Root cause identified and documented\n- Performance bottleneck isolated\n- Solution approach validated","notes":"## Investigation Summary\n\n### What Happened\n\nThree commits were made to fix UI refresh flashing:\n1. **ff6d92d** - Filter events to target file only\n2. **12324b3** - Add content checksumming \n3. **Current state** - Checksum removed, retry logic added\n\n### Code Evolution\n\n**Good Change (12324b3):**\n```rust\n// Calculate checksum of file content\nlet mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();\nbytes.hash(\u0026mut hasher);\nlet new_checksum = hasher.finish();\n\n// Only emit if content changed\nif *last_hash != new_checksum {\n    // emit event\n}\n```\n\n**Bad Change (Current):**\n```rust\nfor i in 0..5 {\n    match std::fs::read(\u0026watch_target) {\n        Ok(bytes) =\u003e break,\n        Err(_) =\u003e std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100 * (i + 1)))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Problems Identified\n\n1. **Blocking Watcher Thread** - sleep() in callback blocks event processing\n2. **Excessive Debounce** - 1000ms is too slow for responsive UI\n3. **Lost Checksum Logic** - No longer deduplicating identical content\n4. **Redundant Retries** - Frontend get_beads() already retries\n\n### Measurements\n\n- Potential blocking time: 1.5s (retry sleeps)\n- Debounce delay: 1.0s\n- Total theoretical delay: 2.5s+ per change\n- User expectation: \u003c500ms response time\n\n### Recommended Solution\n\n1. Restore checksumming from commit 12324b3\n2. Remove retry loop (unnecessary duplication)\n3. Reduce debounce to 200-300ms\n4. Consider async file read if still needed\n\n\n## UPDATE: Code Was Already Fixed\n\nUpon investigation, discovered that:\n1. HEAD commit (12324b3) already contains the good checksumming code\n2. No blocking retry loops in watcher callback\n3. Debounce was 200ms (now optimized to 250ms)\n\n## Remaining Mystery\n\nUser reports system is \"still unbearably slow\" despite good code being in place.\n\nPossible Causes:\n1. **Stale Build** - The running binary may be from before commit 12324b3\n2. **Frontend Issue** - Problem may be in React component rendering, not file watcher  \n3. **processedData Recalculation** - useMemo dependencies might be causing excessive recomputation\n4. **Daemon Sync Frequency** - If daemon is syncing too rapidly, even 250ms debounce groups them\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Verify app is rebuilt with latest code\n2. Profile frontend rendering performance\n3. Check daemon sync frequency\n4.

{"id":"bp6-643","title":"Concurrent Multi-Agent Session Management","description":"Enable multiple agent sessions to run concurrently with UI indicators, session management, and conversation logging. Users can work on different beads simultaneously with independent agent contexts.\n\n## Key Idea: From Single Agent to Agent Orchestra\n\n**Current State (Single Session):**\n- You can only run ONE agent conversation at a time\n- Starting a new agent kills the previous one\n- If you're working on Task A and need quick help on Task B, you lose Task A's context\n- No way to manage multiple parallel workstreams\n\n**New State (Multi-Session):**\n- Run multiple concurrent agent conversations simultaneously\n- Each session is independent and persistent\n- Sessions are identified by UUID and tracked with metadata (bead_id, persona, backend)\n- You can switch between sessions without losing context\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Session Lifecycle Management\n- Create: start_agent_session returns a session_id\n- Track: Each session stores process handle, bead context, persona, CLI backend, status\n- Terminate: terminate_session cleanly kills specific session\n- List: list_active_sessions shows all running sessions\n\n### 2. Context Preservation\n- Each session remembers:\n  - What bead/issue it's working on (bead_id)\n  - What role it's playing (persona: specialist, PM, QA)\n  - What backend it's using (backend_id: Gemini vs Claude Code)\n  - When it was created (created_at)\n  - Its CLI session ID for resume capability\n\n### 3. Active Session Switching\n- switch_active_session(session_id) changes which session is 'in focus'\n- UI can show active session prominently while others run in background\n- Send messages to specific sessions via send_agent_message(session_id, message)\n\n### 4. Event-Driven UI Updates\n- Tauri events keep UI in sync:\n  - session-created: New session started\n  - session-terminated: Session stopped\n  - session-list-changed: Session list updated\n  - active-session-changed: Focus switched\n  - agent-chunk: Now includes session_id for routing output\n\n## What This Enables\n\n### Use Case 1: Parallel Workstreams\nSession 1: Specialist working on bp6-643.001.1 (data structures)\nSession 2: QA Engineer reviewing tests for bp6-642\nSession 3: Product Manager planning next sprint\nAll running concurrently, each maintaining its own context.\n\n### Use Case 2: Quick Context Switches\nYou're debugging a complex issue (Session A), hit a blocker, and need to quickly ask a question about documentation (Session B) without:\n- Losing your debugging session state\n- Having to stop/restart the long-running investigation\n- Mixing contexts between two different problems\n\n### Use Case 3: Different Personas, Different Tasks\n- Specialist session: Deep technical implementation on bp6-643.001.5\n- PM session: Planning breakdown for bp6-644 (next feature)\n- QA session: Writing acceptance tests\nEach persona maintains its own conversation thread, context, and memory.\n\n### Use Case 4: Backend Flexibility\nRun Gemini for fast iteration on simple tasks while Claude Code handles complex architectural decisions—at the same time.\n\n## The Vision\nThis transforms the agent from a single-threaded assistant into a multi-threaded team. Instead of 'I need to finish with Agent 1 before starting Agent 2' you get 'I have 3 agents working in parallel, I'll check on each when needed'. Like going from a single terminal window to tmux with multiple panes—each pane has its own context, but you control them all from one interface.","design":"## Architecture Overview (UPDATED 2026-02-13 post-epic 6dk)\nMulti-session agent system aligned with plugin architecture:\n1.

{"id":"bp6-i9g","title":"Implement non-blocking file watcher with content deduplication","description":"Redesign the file watcher to be non-blocking and efficient.\n\nSolution Architecture:\n1. Remove blocking sleep() calls from watcher callback\n2. Use async file reads or move to separate thread\n3. Restore content checksumming for deduplication\n4. Reduce debounce to reasonable level (200-300ms)\n5. Remove retry logic from watcher (frontend already has this)\n\nImplementation Plan:\n- Spawn async task or use channel to offload file reading\n- Compute checksum and compare before emitting event\n- Only emit 'beads-updated' when content actually changes\n- Use reasonable debounce (200ms) for rapid changes\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- Watcher callback is non-blocking\n- File reads happen asynchronously or on separate thread\n- Content checksum prevents redundant UI refreshes\n- Debounce timing is ≤300ms\n- System responds to changes within 500ms","design":"## Technical Design: Non-Blocking File Watcher\n\n### Architecture Decision\n\n**Option 1: Restore Checksum Approach (RECOMMENDED)**\n- Revert to commit 12324b3 implementation\n- Simple, proven, non-blocking\n- Content deduplication prevents flashing\n- Reduce debounce from 1000ms → 250ms\n\n**Option 2: Channel-Based Async (If needed)**\n- Use std::sync::mpsc for event queueing\n- Spawn dedicated thread for file I/O\n- More complex but allows retry logic if needed\n\n### Recommended: Option 1\n\n```rust\n// In watcher callback (non-blocking)\nif affects_target {\n    // Quick, non-blocking read\n    if let Ok(bytes) = std::fs::read(\u0026watch_target) {\n        let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();\n        bytes.hash(\u0026mut hasher);\n        let new_checksum = hasher.finish();\n        \n        let mut last_hash = last_checksum.lock().unwrap();\n        \n        if *last_hash != new_checksum {\n            *last_hash = new_checksum;\n            \n            // Debounce check\n            let mut last = last_emit.lock().unwrap();\n            let now = Instant::now();\n            if now.duration_since(*last) \u003e= Duration::from_millis(250) {\n                *last = now;\n                let _ = handle.emit(\"beads-updated\", ());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // If read fails, ignore (frontend will retry)\n}\n```\n\n### Key Changes\n1. Remove retry loop entirely\n2. Restore checksum comparison\n3. Reduce debounce to 250ms\n4. Single fast read attempt\n5.

{"id":"bp6-ifn","title":"Beads Daemon Health Monitoring and Async CLI Operations","description":"Implement background monitoring of beads daemon logs to detect and alert users to performance issues, while refactoring CLI subprocess calls to async execution to prevent UI blocking.","design":"# Epic: Beads Daemon Health Monitoring and Async CLI Operations\n\n## Context\nThis epic addresses two critical performance issues in BERT Viz:\n1. Beads daemon can enter infinite loops (repeated file change events) causing high CPU usage\n2. Synchronous bd CLI subprocess calls block the UI for seconds at a time\n\nThese issues combine to create a poor user experience with frozen UIs and wasted resources.\n\n## Problem Details\n\n### Daemon Infinite Loop\n- Symptoms: Repeated \"Import triggered by file change\" every ~3 seconds\n- Root cause: File watcher detects its own git pull operations as \"new\" file changes\n- Impact: High CPU usage, battery drain, unnecessary git operations\n- Current visibility: None - users only notice slowness\n\n### Blocking CLI Operations\n- Symptoms: UI freezes during bd commands (update, close, create, sync)\n- Example: `bd config get sync.branch` takes 5+ seconds and blocks Tauri event loop\n- Root cause: Synchronous subprocess execution in lib.rs\n- Impact: Frozen UI, poor UX, user frustration\n\n## Goals\n\n**Primary:**\n1. Alert users when daemon enters problematic states\n2. Prevent UI blocking during bd CLI operations\n3. Improve overall application responsiveness\n\n**Secondary:**\n1. Provide daemon health visibility in UI\n2. Allow users to configure monitoring preferences\n3. Cache expensive CLI results where safe\n\n## Proposed Features\n\n### Feature 1: Daemon Log Watcher\n- Monitor daemon log output (configured file path or systemd/launchd logs)\n- Parse log lines for error patterns:\n  - Rapid repeated \"Import triggered\" (\u003e3 in 10 seconds = loop detected)\n  - Error messages containing \"failed\", \"error\", \"timeout\"\n  - Performance degradation (operations taking \u003e5 seconds)\n- Emit events to frontend: \"daemon-warning\", \"daemon-error\", \"daemon-recovered\"\n- Debounce to avoid alert spam\n\n### Feature 2: Async CLI Execution\n- Refactor all bd subprocess calls to async/background execution:\n  - `get_sync_branch_name()` - most critical (5+ second blocker)\n  - `update_bead()`, `create_bead()`, `close_bead()`, `reopen_bead()`\n  - Any other bd CLI invocations\n- Use std::thread::spawn or Tokio async/await\n- Maintain error handling (capture stderr/stdout)\n- Preserve all existing functionality\n\n### Feature 3: Toast Notification System\n- Build toast/notification component in React\n- Show daemon warnings: \"Daemon appears stuck - consider restarting\"\n- Show daemon errors: \"Daemon sync failed - check network\"\n- Dismissible, auto-hide after 10 seconds\n- Use existing design system (Tailwind, Lucide icons)\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n**Backend (Rust/Tauri):**\n- Create DaemonLogWatcher struct (similar to BeadsWatcher)\n- Use notify crate to watch log file\n- Parse text logs with regex patterns\n- Maintain state: last_alert_time, loop_count, error_count\n- Emit typed events to frontend\n\n**Frontend (React/TypeScript):**\n- Create Toast component with variants (warning, error, info, success)\n- Listen for daemon events\n- Display notifications with appropriate styling\n- Provide dismiss and \"don't show again\" options\n\n**Configuration:**\n- Add daemon.log_path to app config\n- Add daemon.monitoring_enabled boolean (default: false)\n- UI settings panel for configuration\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n**Performance:**\n- 0ms UI blocking during bd CLI operations (vs 5000ms+ currently)\n- Daemon loop detection within 10 seconds\n- Notifications appear \u003c500ms after event\n\n**Functionality:**\n- All bd operations complete successfully\n- Users notified of all critical daemon issues\n- No false positive alerts (\u003c1% rate)\n\n**Quality:**\n- No race conditions in async code\n- No memory leaks from background threads\n- Graceful cleanup on app shutdown\n- 100% backward compatibility\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Async CLI execution (highest impact, lowest risk)\n2. **Phase 2**: Toast notification component (needed for Phase 3)\n3. **Phase 3**: Daemon log monitoring (depends on Phase 2)\n\n## Risks and Mitigations\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|--------|------------|\n| Tokio adds complexity | Medium | Low | Start with std::thread, migrate later |\n| Logs not accessible | Medium | Medium | Document systemd setup, allow manual config |\n| False positive alerts | High | Low | Conservative thresholds, user dismissal |\n| Async breaks existing code | Low | High | Comprehensive testing, feature flags |\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Fixing the daemon itself (external project)\n- Real-time log streaming to UI\n- Historical log analysis/dashboard\n- Daemon auto-restart functionality\n\n## Dependencies\n- None (standalone work)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All bd CLI calls execute async without blocking UI\n- [ ] Users notified within 10s of daemon entering loop state\n- [ ] Toast notifications appear for daemon errors\n- [ ] Configuration UI allows enabling/disabling monitoring\n- [ ] No performance regression in existing operations\n- [ ] All tests pass including new concurrent operation tests","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"grant@pairti.com.au","created_at":"2026-02-10T07:38:35.23715+11:00","created_by":"Grant Traynor","updated_at":"2026-02-10T07:59:36.965669+11:00","closed_at":"2026-02-10T07:59:36.965669+11:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
