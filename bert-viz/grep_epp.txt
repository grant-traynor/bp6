{"id":"bp6-epp","title":"Dependency-Aware Waterfall Sorting","description":"Implement a sorting algorithm that orders tasks within the same hierarchical level based on their 'blocks' dependencies. This will ensure that blocking tasks appear before the tasks they unblock, resulting in a linear 'waterfall' progression in the Gantt chart and task list instead of a disjointed 'spaghetti' tree.","acceptance_criteria":"1. Tasks within the same hierarchical level are sorted topologically based on 'blocks' dependencies. 2. Blocking tasks appear before the tasks they unblock. 3. The Gantt chart and task list display a linear 'waterfall' progression for dependent tasks. 4. Code inspection confirms the sorting algorithm correctly handles cyclic dependencies or missing links gracefully. Before closing this task, verify via code inspection that all acceptance criteria have been met.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"grant@pairti.com.au","created_at":"2026-02-08T22:59:01.058357+11:00","created_by":"Grant Traynor","updated_at":"2026-02-08T23:25:22.125442+11:00","labels":["epic"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bp6-epp","depends_on_id":"bp6-lcu","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T23:23:01.607396+11:00","created_by":"Grant Traynor"}]}
