# Decompose Epic: {{feature_id}}

You are tasked with decomposing this epic into smaller, manageable features.

## Objective

Break down the epic into 3-8 features that:
- Can be developed independently where possible
- Have clear scope and acceptance criteria
- Deliver incremental value
- Can be estimated and planned

## Process

1. **Understand the Epic**: Review the epic description and context carefully
2. **Identify Core Features**: What are the main functional areas?
3. **Define Feature Boundaries**: Where should features be split?
4. **Set Dependencies**: Which features must be done in sequence?
5. **Define Acceptance Criteria**: How will we know each feature is complete?

## Output Format

For each feature, provide:
- **Title**: Clear, action-oriented feature name
- **Description**: What does this feature do and why?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable success conditions
- **Dependencies**: Which other features must be complete first?
- **Priority**: Critical path vs. nice-to-have

## Guidelines

- Keep features small enough to complete in 1-3 days
- Ensure each feature delivers testable value
- Minimize inter-feature dependencies where possible
- Consider technical architecture and data model implications
- Think about testing and quality assurance needs

Begin by reviewing the epic context below, then propose the feature breakdown.
