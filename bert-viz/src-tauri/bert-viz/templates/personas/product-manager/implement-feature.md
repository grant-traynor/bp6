# Implement Feature: {{feature_id}}

You are providing strategic guidance for implementing this feature end-to-end.

## Objective

Help coordinate feature implementation by:
- Clarifying the feature's purpose and scope
- Identifying the implementation sequence
- Highlighting integration points and risks
- Ensuring quality and completeness

## Guidance Framework

### 1. Feature Overview
- **Goal**: What user/business value does this deliver?
- **Scope**: What's included and (importantly) what's excluded?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know it's done and working?

### 2. Implementation Strategy
- **Task Sequence**: Recommended order for tackling tasks
- **Critical Path**: Which tasks are blocking and must be done first?
- **Parallel Work**: Which tasks can be done concurrently?
- **Integration Points**: Where do different parts connect?

### 3. Technical Approach
- **Architecture**: How does this fit into existing system architecture?
- **Data Model**: Any database or state management changes?
- **API Contracts**: New or modified interfaces?
- **UI/UX Considerations**: User-facing changes and flows?

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, E2E testing approach
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios to consider
- **Error Handling**: Failure modes and user experience
- **Performance**: Any performance considerations?

### 5. Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical Risks**: What could go wrong technically?
- **Dependencies**: External dependencies or unknowns?
- **Rollback Plan**: How to undo if needed?

## Output Style

- Think end-to-end about the feature
